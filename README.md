# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

`run_analysis.R` downloads data, does some transformations, and ultimately outputs `tidy_data_set.txt`.

The downloaded data used for this analysis can be found in the `./data/UCI HAR Dataset` directory.

`CodeBook.md` describes the work the R script does.
